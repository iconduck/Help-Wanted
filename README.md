###  Help! Help help!  
This document is intended to give details on the help I'm looking for. My name's Oliver (@onassar), and I started [Iconduck](https://iconduck.com/) as a side project. I'd really love to involve as many people as possible to make it a great place for developers, designers and anyone else, to find and grab icons and illustrations.

### What's Iconduck?
Very simple: it's an aggregator of open source icons, illustrations and graphics. There's thousands (maybe millions) of them out there, and Iconduck wants to pull them all together. Additionally, our goals are:

- Give credit to the designers, which hopefully helps them pay the bills
- Make Iconduck as useful as possible by building things that are uniquely valuable to developers (eg. being API-first, building integrations with code editors, etc)
- Have a phenomenal UX. Developers pride themselves on efficiency, and so having a great UX to support that is key (eg. keyboard shortcuts, intuitive labelling, etc)
- Be a place for people who want to contribute to Open Source, to do so. I've learnt tons being part of the OSS community, and would love to support others who want to be part of it as well.
- Be a super-duper realible and consistent. This means, having plans that include 6-months and 6-years out. That old, trite remark: "Think in the future, act in the now"

### What do we need help with?

- **Social Media**  
  Need someone to post a few times a week with different icon sets we have available, and just generally engage with other designers and the design community. Be yourself. Be quirky. Have fun.

  What this looks like:  
  - Logging in once a day and just liking or replying to anything. No more than a couple mins
  - Logging in 2 or 3 times a week, and posting an icon set (along with tagging the designers)

- **Researchers**  
  Need someone to help research all the different open source icon, illustration and icon sets. Make it easier for me (or someone else) to write build-scripts to compile them into our codebase.

  What this looks like:  
  - Google Sheets! You scour the web, and keep track of EVERY icon set you can find. If it's not clear what the license is, or whether re-distribution would be appropriate, you reach out to the designer(s) and ask.
  - Really, just be organized, hit up that Google Sheet, and track things about icon sets

- **Developers**
  Have someone support building Iconduck (ideally, with everything being open sourced).

  What this looks like:
  - Writing a Safari Extension
  - Building an Electron App
  - etc etc etc.

### What now?
If you have any interest in helping out, just drop me a line: [onassar@gmail.com](mailto:onassar@gmail.com)

Happy Ducking!
